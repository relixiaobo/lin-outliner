# UI Quality Roadmap

Index + organizing logic for the UI-consistency work that came out of the
2026-06-04/05 design-system review. The deep findings live in
`tmp/ui-review/A…H.md` (gitignored working reports); each plan below distills its
report into actionable work. This file is the map and the **boundary contract**
(who owns what) so the plans don't double-edit the same lines.

Nothing here is built yet — all plans are `draft`/ratified-not-started. Sequencing
respects **A7 (foundation before consumers)** and the **≤2 significant changes in
the review queue** WIP cap: this is a backlog to pull from, not a batch to ship at
once.

## The organizing logic — three layers + a verification pass

The findings sort cleanly by *engineering nature*, which also gives the build order:

**Layer 1 — Foundation (CSS-only tokens/shape).** Lowest risk; everything else
builds on it. Settle the shared mechanism first (A7).
- `design-system-consistency.md` — icon shape/fill, overlay radius, accent-focus
  neutrality, focus-visible, user-select, spacing/z-index, spec sync. *(ratified)*
- `composition-rhythm.md` — cross-surface composition tokens: shared reading
  measure, row-height tier, text-gutter alignment, heading scale, list-row idiom,
  context-menu glass/radius alignment. *(new — from reports F + H)*

**Layer 2 — Primitives (TSX + CSS, migrate call sites; #118 merged — no longer a gate).**
Component consolidation; consumes Layer-1 tokens.
- `button-primitive.md` — `<Button variant>`. *(ratified)*
- `input-primitive.md` — `<Input>/<Textarea>/<Select>/<Field>`. *(new — report C)*
- `feedback-states.md` — `<EmptyState>/<ErrorState>` + outliner empty states +
  loading/skeleton policy + surface aborted turns. *(new — report B)*

**Layer 3 — Behavioral fixes (independent; some out-rank the cosmetics).**
Real bugs / a11y / semantics; can run in parallel with Layers 1–2.
- `responsive-robustness.md` — pane-crush, re-clamp on resize, indent cap,
  tag-bar overflow, width-aware breadcrumb. *(new — report D; highest priority)*
- `keyboard-a11y.md` — menu focus-trap/restore hook, context-menu keyboard,
  outliner tree ARIA, calendar grid, role fixes. *(new — report E)*
- `icon-semantics.md` — action↔icon collisions (Hash, unknown-tool, remove). *(new — report G)*

**Cross-cutting — `dark-mode-contrast-pass.md`** *(new — report A)*: a real
light+dark run to confirm the static contrast risks (0.30/0.16 text, status
colors, faint-on-material) and apply one-token `theme-dark.css` nudges. Runs
**after** Layer 1/2 land so it verifies the final state.

## Boundary contract (dedup — prevents double-editing)

| Finding | Owned by | NOT by |
|---|---|---|
| accent-focus leak (agent-subagent textarea) | `design-system-consistency` §3 | input-primitive (references only) |
| overlay RADIUS of command-palette / confirm-dialog (8→10) | `design-system-consistency` §2 | — |
| ALL text-button shape/fill/size incl. confirm-dialog buttons, danger-hover, 30px | `button-primitive` | composition-rhythm, design-system |
| thinking-level radius | `design-system-consistency` §1c | — |
| context-menu OPAQUE→glass + radius alignment (whole element) | `composition-rhythm` | design-system §2 |
| list-row idiom (3 ways), reading width, row-height, gutter, heading scale | `composition-rhythm` | — |
| dead "Pinned" section (`pinnedNodeIds` always `[]`) | existing `sidebar-pinned-nodes.md` | feedback-states (cross-ref only) |
| empty/loading/error idioms + outliner empty states + skeleton policy | `feedback-states` | — |
| all text-input/select/textarea styling, placeholder, disabled | `input-primitive` | — |

## Dependencies & sequencing

- **PR #118** (codex settings-macOS-clarity) is **MERGED into `main`** — it is the
  baseline now, not an open PR to sequence behind. The gates it once imposed
  (button Wave 2, input-primitive's settings-field migration, every
  `design-system.md` spec edit) are **OPEN**: the settings-touching waves no longer
  need to wait and can fold into each plan's own PR (re-grep against `main`, since
  #118 reshaped `settings-*.css` / `controls.css` / `design-system.md`).
- **First plan to pull (ratified):** `responsive-robustness` is **#1** — P1,
  independent, all 7 bugs verified real.
- **Recommended order:** (1) Layer-3 bugs that don't touch the cosmetic layers can
  start immediately — `responsive-robustness` (#1) and `keyboard-a11y` are the
  highest user-impact. (2) Layer-1 `composition-rhythm` tokens before Layer-2
  primitives that consume them. (3) Primitives + settings-touching waves (no longer
  gated — #118 is merged). (4) `dark-mode-contrast-pass` last. (5) `icon-semantics`
  anytime (small, isolated).
- **Priority cut:** P1 `responsive-robustness`; P2 `keyboard-a11y`,
  `input-primitive`, `feedback-states`, `button-primitive`; P3 `composition-rhythm`,
  `icon-semantics`, `dark-mode-contrast-pass`, `design-system-consistency`.

## Status board

| Plan | Layer | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| design-system-consistency | 1 | earlier sweep | ratified, not started |
| composition-rhythm | 1 | F + H | draft |
| button-primitive | 2 | button audit | ratified, not started |
| input-primitive | 2 | C | draft |
| feedback-states | 2 | B | draft |
| responsive-robustness | 3 | D | draft — **pull first (#1)** |
| keyboard-a11y | 3 | E | draft |
| icon-semantics | 3 | G | draft |
| dark-mode-contrast-pass | x | A | draft |

> Baseline: **PR #118** (settings-macOS-clarity) is **merged into `main`** — its
> former gates on the settings-touching waves are open.
